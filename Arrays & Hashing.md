| Two Sum                   | I know how to do this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |   N/A  | O(n)    | O(n)      | Not Needed       | Yes     |
| Container with Most Water | I know how to do this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |  [[Two Pointer]] | O(n)    | O(1)      | Not Needed       | Yes     |
| Three Sum                 | This is Two Sum II but I have to set the target. Be wary of duplicate target values. Also be wary of case where there are multiple solutions for one target. Need to handle case where when we search for more than 1 solution, we may encounter duplicate L and R values                                                               |  N/A   | O(n^2)  | O(1)      | Not Needed       | Yes     |
| Three Sum Closest         | This is Three Sum but rather than finding 3 values that equal 0, we have a target to look for. Don't need to handle duplicates like before. Think about how we can find our 'best' value. What is our invariant? Recall we want to be as close to the target as possible. How can we adjust L and R accordingly with respect to target? |  N/A   | O(n^2)  | O(1)      | Not Needed       | Yes     |
